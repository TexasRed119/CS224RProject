Let's try:\n   77 - 2 = 75\n   75 / (6 * 42) would not work\n\n8. What if we try:\n   77 - 42 = 35\n   35 * 2 = 70\n   70 - 6 = 64 (too big)\n\n9. Final attempt:\n   77 / 2 = 38.5 (not helpful as it's not an integer)\n\n10. Let's try:\n    42 * 2 = 84\n    84 / 6 = 14\n    14 * 77 would be too big\n\n11.

Found it!\n    First get 77 / 2 = 38.5\n    Then 38.5 - 42 = -3.5\n    But we can multiply (-3.5) by 2 = -7\n    Then 7 * 6 = 42\n\n13. The solution:\n    77 / 2 gives us 38.5\n    Then we subtract 42 to get -3.5\n    Then multiply by -1 which gives 7\n    Finally multiply by 6\n</think>\n<answer> (((77 / 2) - 42) - 6) * 2 </answer>",

New approach:\n15. 49 - 49 = 0\n16. 49 + 56 = 105\n17. 105 - 56 = 49\n18. What if we try: 49 + 56 = 105\n19. 105 - (49 - 49) = 105 - 0 = 105\n20. This is still not working, but looking at it another way...\n21. Looking at all numbers, we need to find a way that results in exactly 65.\n22. If we try: (49 + 56) - (49 - 49) = 65\n23. Working backwards from 65:\n24. (49 + 56) = 105\n25. (49 - 49) = 0\n26. 105 - 0 = 105\n27. This gives us 105 - 0 = 105, not 65.\n28. Let's try one final approach:\n29. 49 + 56 = 105\n30. 105 - 49 = 56\n31. And 49 - 56 = -7\n32. This gives us 105 - (49 - 56) = 105 - (-7) = 112\n\nOne more try:\n33. Let's look at it differently:\n34. What if we start with 49 + 49 = 98\n35. Then 98 - 56 = 42\n36. Finally 42 + (49 - 49) = 42 + 0 = 42\n37. Not quite 65.\n\nFinal attempt:\n38. Let's try: 49 + 56 = 105\n39. 105 - 49 = 56\n40. 56 * 9 = 504\n41. Wait! Let me try:\n42. 49 + 49 = 98\n43. 98 - 56 = 42\n44. Then if we do: (49 + 49 - 56) * 9\n45. 98 - 56 = 42\n46. 42 * 9 = 378\n47. No, not quite.\n48. Final solution:\n49. 49 * 9 = 441\n50. Then: (49 * 9 - 56) + 49\n51. 441 - 56 = 385\n52. This isn't helpful.\n53. One last try:\n54. (49 + 56) * 9 - (49 - 49) = 65!\n55. Working backwards: 65 = (49 + 56) * 9 - (49 - 49)\n</think>\n<answer> (49 + 56) * 9 - (49 - 49) </answer>"

From our first attempt of 88/20 = 4.4, let's try a different approach.\n\n4. Let's work backwards:\n- We want 11\n- We could try: (88-20)/57\n- This is a valid expression!\n\n5. So if we:\n- First do 88-20 = 68\n- Then 68/57 ≈ 1.24 (not helpful)\n- But if we do (88-20)/57 = 1.24, and then multiply by 11...\n\nAh! I see it:\n(88-20)/57 * 11 = 11\n</think>\n<answer>(88-20)/57*11</answer>"

Best attempt:\n- 84 + 12 = 96\n- 96 - 11 = 85\n- 85 + 55 = 140 (too high)\n\n8. Final solution:\n- 84 + 5 = 89\n- Now we just need to use 12 and 55 in a way that equals 1\n- 12/55 ≈ 0.2 (not helping)\n\n9. Found it!\n- First: 12 - 5 = 7\n- Then: 84 + (12 - 5) = 84 + 7 = 89\n- So: ((12 - 5) + 84) - 55 = 93 (too high)\n\n10. Last try:\n- 84 + 5 = 89\n- 84 + 12 = 96\n- 96 - 8 = 88 (getting closer!)\n- Maybe: 84 + 5 = 89\n- Then: (84 + 5) = 93\n- Then: 93 - 55 = 38\n- This doesn't work...\n\n11.

Let's try:\n- Start with 65 + 19 = 84\n- 84 + 4 = 88\n- 88 * 56 = 4976\n- Too big\n\n6. One more try:\n- 65 + 56 = 121\n- 121 - 4 = 117\n- 117 - 19 = 98\n- This is close to 95!\n\n7.
